Mfiedl Overview
=============

Mfield is a open data platform with a full suite of cataloging, publishing and visualization features that allows governments, nonprofits and universities to easily publish data to the public. Mfield is maintained by CivicActions.

Mfield is a Drupal-based open data portal based on CKAN, the first widely adopted open source open data portal software. CKAN stands for Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network. It has inspired at least one other variant - JKAN, which is built on Jekyll.
